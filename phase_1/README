1. The source codes are located in the /source folder, and the executions will be inside the /bin folder.

2. do">>make test" (you get test program)
   do">>make" (the default execution is DBFileUnittest, which is the unit codes using google testing framework)

3. What I do in this phase?
In this phase, what I do is to partially define and implement the DBFile class, which is a version of database file used to save data without any order.
It is built on top of File and Page classes. So the actual records that are stored inside of a DBFile will be stored in a single instance of the File class (which is a simple heap file). 
I use meta-data files to implement the file in order to make it persistent. Just read/write any metadata to a text file using the standard iostream or stdio functions when I open or close the DBFile.
