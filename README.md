# Database-Management-System
* Developed a database management system for a subset of SQL and some basic relational algebra operations (select,
project, and join).
* Implemented the Heap Files, Sorted Files, B+-Tree, Query Evaluation Algorithms, Query Optimizer in three months. Used tpchgen
program provided by TPCH website, the famous standard database benchmark, to generate the big test data and utilized
the google test framework to enhance my testing.
* If you want to run this project, please remember to download, compile, and run the tpchgen program available from the TPC-H website to generate your own test data. Make a new folder /data inside each phase_x folder, copy the generated data into this folder!!!!!
